Upon successfully passing this assessment you will be invited to the final step of our interview process - a team interview. \n","\n","For the technical assessment, we have provided you with a sample database to process and explore. This data, although artificial, is a small representation of the kinds of problems we work on day to day. In this case, a fencing company has come to you with a dataset detailing some of the information they gather about their customers. Unfortunately they did not provide you with the schema of their database. \n","\n","Take a look at the data in the `fence_co.db` database. Convert the data to a pandas dataframe format and perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the tables to see how they relate. Use any tools available for visualizations and conclusions. Create a final dataframe with data from all three tables in the database.\n","\n","\n","#### Requirements\n","Ideally, you will spend about 2-3 hours over the next week processing and exploring the data in an attempt to find something interesting. As you are converting this data think about converting some of the fields to appropriate types and formats. Please provide insights into the data and a data quality report. As the vast majority of our projects are done in python, we ask that you use *python 3 with pandas* and submit a Jupyter notebook with your code along with a report that highlights insights and describes your thought process (we expect your Jupyter notebook to serve the purpose of such report, please donâ€™t send additional files)."]},{"metadata":{"id":"dDweF4QHHT4G","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["import sqlite3\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Connect to database\n","conn = sqlite3.connect('fence_co.db')"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
